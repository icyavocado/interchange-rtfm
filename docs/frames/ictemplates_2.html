<H2>1.1. Overview</H2>
<P>The search builder can be used to generate very complex reports on the database or to help in the construction of ITL templates. Select a &quot;Base table&quot; that will be the foundation for the report. Specify the maximum number of rows to be returned at one time, and whether to show only unique entries.</P>
<P>The &quot;Search filter&quot; narrows down the list of rows returned by matching table columns based on various criteria. Up to three separate conditions can be specified. The returned rows must match all criteria.</P>
<P>Finally, select any sorting options desired for displaying the results and narrow down the list of columns returned if desired. Clicking &quot;Run&quot; will run the search immediately and display the results. &quot;Generate definition&quot; will display an ITL tag that can be placed in a template and that will return the results when executed.</P>
<P>To build complex order forms and reports, Interchange has a complete tag language with over 80 different functions called Interchange Tag Language (ITL). It allows access to and control over any of an unlimited number of database tables, multiple shopping carts, user name/address information, discount, tax and shipping information, search of files and databases, and much more.</P>
<P>There is some limited conditional capability with the [<A HREF="ictags_72.html#if">if</A>] tag, but when doing complex operations, use of embedded Perl/ASP should be strongly considered. Most of the tests use Perl code, but Interchange uses the Safe.pm module with its default restrictions to help ensure that improper code will not crash the server or modify the wrong data.</P>
<P>Perl can also be embedded within the page and, if given the proper permission by the system administrator, call upon resources from other computers and networks.</P>
