<H2>3.4. Streamline your catalog for CVS</H2>
<H3><A NAME="Considerations about what to import into CVS">3.4.1. Considerations about what to import into CVS</A></H3>
<P>From your working directory (<TT>/tmp/import_foundation</TT>), decide which files will be in the CVS repository, and which will not.  While it is entirely possible to import the entire catalog into the repository unchanged, I usually prefer to doctor my directories up before letting them into my repository because of several reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Will the file be modified by another source?</UL>
<P>For example, <TT>/etc/order.number</TT> is modified by Interchange when run. But not everyone will use a local development model that includes running Interchange on a directly checked-out copy of their source.  Which means this specific issue is avoided if you upload every edit before viewing your changes on a server.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The likelihood that you will modify the file.</UL>
<P>For example, if I am certain that I wont every want to modify the session/ files directly, then I probably wouldn't need to manage that through CVS, but I do import the empty session/ directory to make it easier when setting up new catalogs.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Speed.</UL>
<P>Managing less files in the repository takes away from the amount of time required for CVS checkout, update, branching, and other CVS actions.  For most, this amount of time is small already, but it is a consideration for some.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ease of use.</UL>
<P>Ease of use is one reason not to remove anything from your catalog before importing it, because it creates the ability to have a completely working catalog from just one checkout (much like the CVS tree at interchange.redhat.com).  Whereas if you leave out other directories like etc/ session/ orders/, etc., then you must first combine your checkout with the other working parts of a catalog before the catalog is viable.  But this is slower and will bring up lots of harmless notification and warning messages (about changed local versions) if you run Interchange on your local source copy (because Interchange will touch etc/ session/ orders/, etc. directly, and then warn that your local copy has changed from the CVS copy).  You may be able to manage some of these notifications and warnings with <TT>CVSROOT/cvsignore</TT> or <TT>$CVSIGNORE</TT>, see the <A HREF="ic_howto_cvs_47.html">Resources</A> appendix for more details.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Remove files that aren\'t needed in CVS">3.4.2. Remove files that aren't needed in CVS</A></H3>
<P>Here is an example of some directories to remove.  If you do move more directories, be sure to move them to a directory that you can later use to re-unite with a checked-out copy for a working catalog.  But here I chose just to move files that are not needed for a template &quot;skeleton&quot; catalog.</P>
<P>The images directory is typically symlinked to /var/www/html/foundation/images, so I remove this symlink from the working copy, and replace it with an exact copy which will go into the CVS repository.</P>
<PRE>
cd /tmp/import_foundation
mkdir /tmp/import_foundation_nonCVS

#Setup images directory
rm images
cp -a /var/www/html/foundation/images .

#Remove
mv error.log logs/* orders/* session/* tmp/* upload/*  \
        /tmp/import_foundation_nonCVS
