<H2>4.1. Advanced Multi-level Order Pages</H2>
<P>An unlimited number of order checking profiles can be defined with the <I>OrderProfile</I> directive, or by defining order profiles in scratch variables. This allows a multi-level ordering process, with checking for format and validity at every stage.</P>
<P>To custom-configure the error message, place it after the format check requirement.</P>
<P>Specifications take the form of an order page variable (like name or address), followed by an equals sign and one of five check types:</P>
<P><B>required</B></P>
<UL>
A non-blank value is required</UL>
<P><B>mandatory</B></P>
<UL>
Must be non-blank, and must have been specified on this form, not a saved value from a previous form</UL>
<P><B>phone</B></P>
<UL>
The field must look like a phone number, by a very loose specification allowing numbers from all countries</UL>
<P><B>phone_us</B></P>
<UL>
Must have US phone number formatting, with area code</UL>
<P><B>state</B></P>
<UL>
Must be a US state, including DC and Puerto Rico.</UL>
<P><B>province</B></P>
<UL>
Must be a Canadian province or pre-1997 territory.</UL>
<P><B>state_province</B></P>
<UL>
Must be a US state or Canadian province.</UL>
<P><B>zip</B></P>
<UL>
Must have US postal code formatting, with optional ZIP+4. Also called by the alias <TT>us_postcode</TT>.</UL>
<P><B>ca_postcode</B></P>
<UL>
Must have Canadian postal code formatting. Checks for a valid first letter.</UL>
<P><B>postcode</B></P>
<UL>
Must have Canadian or US postal code formatting.</UL>
<P><B>true</B></P>
<UL>
Field begins with <B>y</B>, <B>1</B>, or <B>t</B> (Yes, 1, or True) - not case sensitive</UL>
<P><B>false</B></P>
<UL>
Field begins with <B>n</B>, <B>0</B>, or <B>f</B> (No, 0, or False) - not case sensitive</UL>
<P><B>email</B></P>
<UL>
Rudimentary email address check, must have an '@' sign, a name, and a minimal domain</UL>
<P><B>regex</B></P>
<UL>
A regular expression to check against. To check that all submissions of the &quot;foo&quot; variable have &quot;bar&quot; at the beginning, do:</UL>
<PRE>
            foo=regex ^bar
</PRE>
<UL>
You can add an error message by putting it in quotes at the end:</UL>
<PRE>
       foo=regex ^bar &quot;You must have bar at the beginning of this&quot;
</PRE>
<UL>
If you want to use a backslash to introduce a Perl literal like <TT>\w</TT>, you must double the backslash, i.e.</UL>
<PRE>
            foo=regex ^bar\\w+$ &quot;You must have 'bar' followed by only word characters&quot;
</PRE>
<P><B>length</B></P>
<UL>
A range of lengths you want the input to be:</UL>
<PRE>
       foo=length 4-10
</PRE>
<UL>
That will require <TT>foo</TT> be from 4 to 10 characters long.</UL>
<P><B>unique</B></P>
<UL>
Tests to see that the value would be a unique key in a table:</UL>
<PRE>
       foo=unique userdb Sorry, that username is already taken
</PRE>
<P><B>filter</B></P>
<UL>
Runs the value through an Interchange filter and checks that the returned value is equal to the original value.</UL>
<PRE>
       foo=filter entities Sorry, no HTML allowed
</PRE>
<UL>
To check for all lower-case characters:</UL>
<PRE>
            foo=filter lower Sorry, no uppercase characters
</PRE>
<P>Also, there are pragmas that can be used to change behavior:</P>
<P><B>&amp;charge</B></P>
<UL>
Perform a real-time charge operation. If set to any value but &quot;custom&quot;, it will use Interchange's CyberCash routines. To set to something else, use the value &quot;custom ROUTINE&quot;. The ROUTINE should be a GlobalSub which will cause the charge operation to occur -- if it returns non-blank, non-zero the profile will have succeeded. If it returns 0 or undef or blank, the profile will return failure.</UL>
<P><B>&amp;credit_card</B></P>
<UL>
Checks the mv_credit_card_* variables for validity. If set to &quot;standard&quot;, it will use Interchange's <TT>encrypt_standard_cc</TT> routines. This destroys the CGI value of mv_credit_card_number -- if you don't want that to happen (perhaps to save it for sending to CyberCash) then add the word <TT>keep</TT> on the end.
<BR>
Example:</UL>
<PRE>
        # Checks credit card number and destroys number after encryption
        # The charge operation can never work
    
        &amp;credit_card=standard
        &amp;charge=custom authorizenet
    
        # Checks credit card number and keeps number after encryption
        # The charge operation can now work
    
        &amp;credit_card=standard keep
        &amp;charge=custom authorizenet
</PRE>
<UL>
You can supply your own check routine with a GlobalSub:</UL>
<PRE>
        &amp;credit_card=check_cc
</PRE>
<UL>
The <TT>GlobalSub</TT> check_cc will be used to check and encrypt the credit card number, and its return value will be used to determine profile success.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>fail</B></P>
<UL>
Sets the mv_failpage value.</UL>
<PRE>
        &amp;fail=page4
</PRE>
<UL>
If the submit process succeeds, the user will be sent to the page <TT>page4</TT>.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>fatal</B></P>
<UL>
Set to '&amp;fatal=yes' if an error should generate the error page.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>final</B></P>
<UL>
Set to '&amp;final=yes' if a successful check should cause the order to be placed.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>update</B></P>
<UL>
Set to '&amp;update=yes' if a successful check should cause the variable to be copied from the CGI space to the Values space. This is like [update values] except only for that variable.
<BR>
This is typically used when using a <TT>mv_form_profile</TT> check so that a failing check will not cause all values to be reset to their former state upon returning to the form.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>return</B></P>
<UL>
Causes profile processing to terminate with either a success or failure depending on what follows. If it is non-blank and non-zero, the profile succeeds.</UL>
<PRE>
        # Success :)
        &amp;return 1
    
        # Failure :\
        &amp;return 0
</PRE>
<UL>
Will ignore the &amp;fatal pragma, but &amp;final is still in effect if set.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>set</B></P>
<UL>
Set a user session variable to a value, i.e. <TT>&amp;set=mv_email [value email]</TT>. This will not cause failure if blank or zero.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>setcheck</B></P>
<UL>
Set a user session variable to a value, i.e. <TT>&amp;set=mv_email [value email]</TT>.  This <B>will</B> cause failure if set to a blank or zero. It is usually placed at the end after a &amp;fatal pragma would have caused the process to stop if there was an error -- can also be used to determine pass/fail based on a derived value, as it will cause failure if it evaluates to zero or a blank value.</UL>
<P><B><TT>&amp;</TT>success</B></P>
<UL>
Sets the mv_successpage value. Example:</UL>
<PRE>
        &amp;success=page5
</PRE>
<UL>
If the submit process succeeds, the user will be sent to the page <TT>page5</TT>.</UL>
<P>As an added measure of control, the specification is evaluated for the special Interchange tags to provide conditional setting of order parameters. With the <TT>[perl]</TT> <TT>[/perl]</TT> capability, quite complex checks can be done. Also, the name of the page to be displayed on an error can be set in the <TT>mv_failpage</TT> variable.</P>
<P>The following file specifies a simple check of formatted parameters:</P>
<PRE>
 name=required You must give us your name.
 address=required Oops! No address.
 city=required
 state=required
 zip=required
 email=required
 phone_day=phone_us XXX-XXX-XXXX phone-number for US or Canada
 &amp;fatal=yes
 email=email Email address missing the domain?
 &amp;set=mv_email [value email]
 &amp;set=mv_successpage ord/shipping
</PRE>
<P>The profile above only performs the &amp;set directives if all of the previous checks have passed -- the &amp;fatal=yes will stop processing after the check of the email address if any of the previous checks failed.</P>
<P>If you want to place multiple order profiles in the same file, separate them with __END__, which must be on a line by itself.</P>
<P>User-defined check routines can be defined in a GlobalSub:</P>
<PRE>
    GlobalSub &lt;&lt;EOF
    sub set_up_extra_check {
        BEGIN {
            package Vend::Order;
            sub _pt_postcode {
                # $ref is to Vend::Session-&gt;{'values'} hash
                # $var is the passed name of the variable
                # $val is current value of checked variable
                my($ref, $var, $val) = @_;

                if ($ref-&gt;{country} =~ /^(PT|portugal)$/i) {
                    return $val =~ /^\d\d\d\d$/ ?
                        (1, $var, '') : (undef, $var, &quot;not a Portugese postal code&quot;);
                }
                else {
                    return (1, $var, '');
                }
            }
        }
    }
    EOF
</PRE>
<P>Now you can specify in an order profile:</P>
<PRE>
  postcode=pt_postcode
</PRE>
<P>Very elaborate checks are possible. There must be an underscore preceding the routine name. The return value of the subroutine should be a three-element array, consisting of:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the pass/fail ('1' or 'undef') status of the check;
<LI>the name of the variable which was checked;
<LI>a standard error message for the failure, in case a custom one has not been specified in the order profile.</OL>
<P>The latter two elements are used by the <TT>[error]</TT> tag for on-screen display of form errors. The checkout page of the Foundation demo includes examples of this.</P>
