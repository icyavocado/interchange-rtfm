DESCRIPTION
       Spell Checker to be based on ispell (or maybe aspell).

GOAL
       Add spell checking capabilities to input fields, IC-tags
       and pages.

FEATURES
       table-editor tag
       Have an option (link/button) next to an input field to
       spell check the contents of that field; This link should
       only show when 'asked' for it by setting an option in the
       table-editor eg. field0.spell=yes

       The spell check option could also be made available to
       other input fields in the UI.

       Page editor
       Have an option (eg. next to preview button) to spell check
       the content section of a page.  Decission has to be made
       whether we spell check the page with IC tags or the
       resulting HTML page (or both?).

COMMENTS
       Any comments, ideas and, other input regarding this
       feature are much appreciated.  Thanks for your
       cooperation!
