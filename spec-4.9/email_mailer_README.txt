NEED
       Store owners need to be able to send promotional
       offerings, discounts, seasonal promotions, etc. to
       customers via email. This will benefit the store owner in
       the following ways:

          Allow contact with the customer other than during the
           shopping experience.

          Allows the store owner to reward repeat customers and
           do specific promotioning.

          Provides another customer touch point for
           personalization.

          Provides another touch point for engaging inactive
           customers.

PROPOSAL
       The feature should be voluntary for the customer, so the
       checkout interface should come equipped with a checkbox
       for enablement. The feature should allow the store owner
       to do email mailings to targeted groups, so an interface
       in the admin would be needed to allow the store owner to
       create mailer "groups". It would be nice if the store
       owner could search tables for specific combinations of
       variables (for instance, customers from Detroit that
       purchased three self-help manuals in a three month span)
       and output an email address list. The content of the
       email, whether html or text, would be the responsibility
       of the user. The first priority of this feature would be
       to generate the list of email addresses. Once the text is
       generated, the option to save the text/html for later use
       would be desirable.
