PREREQUISITES
       CyberCash connection kit V3.2.0.4

DESCRIPTION
       The Vend::Payment::CyberCash module implements the
       cybercash() routine for use with Interchange. It is
       compatible on a call level with the other Interchange
       payment modules -- in theory (and even usually in
       practice) you could switch from Authorize.net to CyberCash
       with a few configuration file changes.

       To enable this module, place this directive in
       interchange.cfg:

           Require module Vend::Payment::CyberCash

       This should be in interchange.cfg or a file included from
       it, but it is actually in by default to maintain backward
       compatibility with legacy CyberCash installations.

       Make sure CreditCardAuto is off (default in Interchange
       demos).

       Make sure the CyberCash Merchant connection kit is
       installed and working.  It requires the following steps:

       1.  Obtain the CyberCash modules, prefereably version
           3.2.0.4 though 3.2.0.5 and above should work if you
           add "DebugFile /dev/null" in interchange.cfg. Ask
           around on the list if you need older versions.

       2.  Install the modules, then find the directory where
           they are and copy them to /path_to_interchange/lib.
           Include the following files:

               CCMckDirectLib3_2.pm  CCMckLib3_2.pm  MCKencrypt
               CCMckErrno3_2.pm      MCKdecrypt      computeMD5hash

           Make sure the program files (non-.pm) are executable.

       3.  Edit CC*.pm to adjust the paths for MCKencrypt,
           MCKdecrypt, and computeMD5hash.

             in CCMckDirectLib3_2.pm:
               $MCKencrypt = "/path_to_interchange/lib/MCKencrypt";
               $MCKdecrypt = "/path_to_interchange/lib/MCKdecrypt";

             in CCMckLib3_2.pm:
               $computehash = "/path_to_interchange/lib/computeMD5hash";


       4.  Restart Interchange and make sure you get the message:

               CyberCash module found (Version 3.x)


       The mode can be named anything, but the gateway parameter
       must be set to cybercash. To make it the default payment
       gateway for all credit card transactions in a specific
       catalog, you can set in catalog.cfg:

           Variable   MV_PAYMENT_MODE  cybercash

       It uses any of the applicable standard settings from
       Interchange payment. Any time we speak of a setting, it is
       obtained either first from the tag/call options, then from
       an Interchange order Route named for the mode, then
       finally a default global payment variable, For example,
       the configfile parameter would be specified by:

           [charge mode=cybercash configfile="/path/to/the/merchant_conf"]

       or

           Route cybercash configfile /path/to/the/merchant_conf

       or

           Variable MV_PAYMENT_CONFIGFILE    /path/to/the/merchant_conf

       The active settings are:

       configfile
           Your CyberCash merchant_conf file, usually created
           when you installed the MCK.  Global parameter is
           MV_PAYMENT_CONFIGFILE.

       precision
           The number of decimal digits to be included in the
           amount. Default is 2.

       currency
           The international currency code to use. Default is
           usd. Must be supported by CyberCash.

       Items supported, but never normally used, are:

       host
           The CyberCash host to use. Default is set in the
           merchant_conf file, and is not normally changed by the
           user. No global parameter is used for fear of conflict
           with another payment gateway -- must be set in the
           Route or direct option.

       transaction
           The type of transaction to be run. Valid values are:

               Interchange mode    CyberCash mode
               ----------------    -----------------
               sale                mauthcapture
               auth                mauthonly

           IMPORTANT NOTE: In most cases, you cannot control your
           transaction type, it is set at
           http://amps.cybercash.com.

       remap
           This remaps the form variable names to the ones needed
           by CyberCash. See the payment documentation for
           details.

       Troubleshooting

       Try the instructions above, then enable test mode at
       http://amps.cybercash.com.  A test order should complete.
       Exam

       Then try a sale with the card number 4111 1111 1111 1111
       and a valid expiration date. The sale should be denied,
       and the reason should be in [data session payment_error].

       If nothing works:

       o   Make sure you "Require"d the module in
           interchange.cfg:

               Require module Vend::Payment::CyberCash


       o   Make sure the CyberCash Merchant connection kit is
           installed and working. Test with CyberCash's supplied
           routines.

       o   Check the error logs, both catalog and global.

       o   Make sure you set your payment parameters properly. At
           the minimum, you will need:

               Route  cybercash   configfile   /path/to/merchant_conf

       o   Make sure you have a payment mode set if you are not
           calling it with &charge=cybercash:

               Variable  MV_PAYMENT_MODE  cybercash

           Everything is case-sensitive, make sure values match.

       o   Try an order, then put this code in a page:

               <XMP>
               [calc]
                   my $string = $Tag->uneval( { ref => $Session->{payment_result} });
                   $string =~ s/{/{\n/;
                   $string =~ s/,/,\n/g;
                   return $string;
               [/calc]
               </XMP>

           That should show what happened.

BUGS
       There is actually nothing *in* Vend::Payment::CyberCash.
       It changes packages to Vend::Payment and places things
       there.
