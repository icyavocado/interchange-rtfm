NAME
       Vend::Payment::Linkpoint - Interchange Linkpoint Support

SYNOPSIS
           &charge=linkpoint

               or

           [charge mode=linkpoint param1=value1 param2=value2]

PREREQUISITES
           LPERL

DESCRIPTION
       The Vend::Payment::Linkpoint module implements the linkpoint() routine
       for use with Interchange. It is compatible on a call level with the
       other Interchange payment modules -- in theory (and even usually in
       practice) you could switch from CyberCash to Linkpoint with a few con-
       figuration file changes.

       To enable this module, place this directive in "interchange.cfg":

           Require module Vend::Payment::Linkpoint

       This must be in interchange.cfg or a file included from it.

       Make sure CreditCardAuto is off (default in Interchange demos).

       The mode can be named anything, but the "gateway" parameter must be set
       to "linkpoint". To make it the default payment gateway for all credit
       card transactions in a specific catalog, you can set in "catalog.cfg":

           Variable MV_PAYMENT_MODE linkpoint

       It uses several of the standard settings from Interchange payment. Any
       time we speak of a setting, it is obtained either first from the
       tag/call options, then from an Interchange order Route named for the
       mode, then finally a default global payment variable, For example, the
       "id" parameter would be specified by:

           [charge mode=linkpoint id=YourLinkpointID]

       or

           Route linkpoint id YourLinkpointID

       or

           Variable MV_PAYMENT_ID YourLinkpointID

       Required settings are "id" and "keyfile".

       The active settings are:

       host
           Your LinkPoint Secure Payment Gateway (LSPG) hostname. Usually
           secure.linkpt.net (production) or staging.linkpt.net (testing).

       keyfile
           File name of the merchant security certificate. This file should
           contain the RSA private key and the certificate, otherwise you get
           an error like "Unable to open/parse client certificate file."

       id  Store number assigned to your merchant account.

       transaction
           The type of transaction to be run. Valid values are:

               Interchange         Linkpoint
               ----------------    -----------------
                   auth            preauth
                   sale            sale

           Default is "sale".

       Troubleshooting

       If nothing works:

       o   Make sure you "Require"d the module in interchange.cfg:

               Require module Vend::Payment::Linkpoint

       o   Make sure lpperl (v3.0.012+) is installed and working. You can test
           to see whether your Perl thinks they are:

               perl -Mlpperl -e 'print "It works.\n"'

           If it "It works." and returns to the prompt you should be OK (pre-
           suming they are in working order otherwise).

       o   Make sure curl is installed and working.  Lpperl uses curl to con-
           tact Linkpoint.

       o   Check the error logs, both catalog and global.

       o   Make sure you set your payment parameters properly.

       o   Try an order, then put this code in a page:

               <XMP>
               [calc]
                   my $string = $Tag->uneval( { ref => $Session->{payment_result} });
                   $string =~ s/{/{\n/;
                   $string =~ s/,/,\n/g;
                   return $string;
               [/calc]
               </XMP>

           That should show what happened.

BUGS
       There is actually nothing *in* Vend::Payment::Linkpoint. It changes
       packages to Vend::Payment and places things there.
