SYNOPSIS
           &charge=echo

               or

           [charge mode=echo param1=value1 param2=value2]


PREREQUISITES
       If you have not done so already, you will need to sign up
       for an ECHO account.  You will be provided an ID and a PIN
       (also known as 'secret').  You may also sign up for a test
       account at the following URL:

           http://www.echo-inc.com/echotestapp.php

       This subroutine uses the OpenECHO module.  Make sure
       OpenECHO.pm is in your @INC array.  It is available for
       download, see the following URLs:

           http://www.openecho.com/
           http://www.echo-inc.com/

       The OpenECHO.pm module itself has some additional
       prerequisites:

           Net::SSLeay

               or

           LWP::UserAgent and Crypt::SSLeay

       Only one of these need be present and working.
       Net::SSLeay is preferred as some have reported problems
       using LWP::UserAgent and Crypt::SSLeay.

           URL::Escape

       This module is used to write some of the URLs used by the
       OpenECHO module.  It is recommended that you read the
       documention for the OpenECHO module itself in addition to
       this document.

DESCRIPTION
       The Vend::Payment::ECHO module implements the echo()
       routine for use with Interchange. It is compatible on a
       call level with the other Interchange payment modules --
       in theory (and even usually in practice) you could switch
       from CyberCash to ECHO with a few configuration file
       changes.

       To enable this module, place this directive in
       interchange.cfg:

           Require module Vend::Payment::ECHO

       This must be in interchange.cfg or a file included from
       it.

       NOTE: Make sure CreditCardAuto is off (default in
       Interchange demos).

       The mode can be named anything, but the gateway parameter
       must be set to echo. To make it the default payment
       gateway for all credit card transactions in a specific
       catalog, you can set in catalog.cfg:

           Variable MV_PAYMENT_MODE  echo

       It uses several of the standard settings from Interchange
       payment. Any time we speak of a setting, it is obtained
       either first from the tag/call options, then from an
       Interchange order Route named for the mode, then finally a
       default global payment variable, For example, the id
       parameter would be specified by:

           Route echo id Your_ECHO_ID

       or  (with only ECHO as a payment provider)

            Variable MV_PAYMENT_ID   Your_ECHO_ID

       or

            Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_ID   Your_ECHO_ID

       or

            [charge mode=echo id=Your_ECHO_ID]

       The active settings are:

       id  Your account ID, supplied by ECHO when you sign up.
           Global parameter is MV_PAYMENT_ID or ECHO_PAYMENT_ID.

       secret
           Your account password, selected by you or provided by
           ECHO when you sign up.  Global parameter is
           MV_PAYMENT_SECRET or ECHO_PAYMENT_SECRET.

       others...
           If planning to do AUTH_ONLY or other with special
           admin page Variable MV_PAYMENT_REMAP
           order_id=mv_order_id auth_code=mv_auth_code

               Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_ORDER_TYPE         S
                       # S for "self-service" orders
                       # F for hosted or ISP orders
               Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_ISP_ECHO_ID        123<4567890
               Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_ISP_PIN            12345608
               Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_MERCHANT_EMAIL     merchant@merchant.com
               Variable ECHO_PAYMENT_DEBUG              F
                       # C causes ECHO to return a statement of conformity
                       # T or TRUE causes ECHO to return additional debug information
                       # Any other value turns off ECHO debugging


       Example Configuration

       This is an example configuration that one would add to
       catalog.cfg:

           Variable MV_PAYMENT_ID      Your_ECHO_ID
           Variable MV_PAYMENT_SECRET  Your_ECHO_secret
           Variable MV_PAYMENT_MODE    echo


       Troubleshooting

       Try a sale with the card number 4111 1111 1111 1111 and a
       valid expiration date. The sale should be denied, and the
       reason should be in [data session payment_error].

       If nothing works:

       o   Make sure you "Require"d the module in
           interchange.cfg:

               Require module Vend::Payment::ECHO


       o   Make sure the ECHO OpenECHO.pm module is available
           either in your path or in /path_to_interchange/lib.

       o   Check the error logs, both catalog and global.

       o   Make sure you set your account ID and secret properly.

       o   Try an order, then put this code in a page:

               <XMP>
               [calc]
                   my $string = $Tag->uneval( { ref => $Session->{payment_result} });
                   $string =~ s/{/{\n/;
                   $string =~ s/,/,\n/g;
                   return $string;
               [/calc]
               </XMP>

           That should show what happened.

       o   If all else fails, Interchange consultants are
           available to help with integration for a fee.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Because this library calls an executable, you should
       ensure that no untrusted users have write permission on
       any of the system directories or Interchange software
       directories.

NOTES
       There is actually nothing *in* Vend::Payment::ECHO. It
       changes packages to Vend::Payment and places things there.
