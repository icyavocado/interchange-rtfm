		<p><font size="-2" color="navy" face="Verdana"><b>by <a href="http://www.Digital808.com">Digital808.com</a> - Award Winning&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Site Design/Development</b></font></p>
		<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This tutorial will help you to understand how you can add / delete / modify a product.  We will add a product called THX1138, then modify it and finally delete it.</font>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">First go ahead and log into Interchange. &nbsp;If you do not have the username and password for Admin then please let me know.</font></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">ADDING&nbsp;PRODUCTS:</font></b></p>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">click on Items (you should now be in the main area where all of your products reside).</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Click on CREATE&nbsp;NEW&nbsp;ITEM and fill out all of the appropriate fields:</font>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">SKU</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Short Description - This is a brief snippet of sentence to tell users what this product is (go ahead and type in:&nbsp;First Movie by Lucas)</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Product Group - This is the group in which the product will sit in (go ahead and select any of the groups already present)</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Product Category - This is the category a product will sit in (again select one that is already present)</font>

				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Image - This is the main image that the product will have. &nbsp;Make sure you upload the image to www/cart/images/items</font>

				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There is one more thing that we need to do in order to show that the product is available in the Inventory.</font>
				<ul>
					<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Click on top on Inventory and inside of ON&nbsp;HAND put in a very large number regardless of your actual inventory. &nbsp;I would recommend putting in 9999.  The reason behind this is simple;  you don't want your customers to leave a web site if you don't have that item. &nbsp;If anything do your best to obtain this product and thats that.</font>
					<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Make sure it says IN&nbsp;STOCK and click on OK</font>
				</ul>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">OK&nbsp;thats all we will fill out since these are the basics of what a product needs to show up.</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">CLICK ON OK and we are done creating the product!  If you want go ahead and go into your store and either do a search for the item we just made THX1138 or go to the category / subcategory you selected and find it that way.</font>

			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">for Label also type in COLORS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whats the difference between Name and Label? &nbsp;Simple the Name is the word(s) that will show up next to the drop down selection and the Label is the word that will show up in the email you receive of what the customer selects.</font>

			</ul>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">click on OK&nbsp;and repeat this process for the different sizes. &nbsp;When you get to X&nbsp;Large you can just make the price equal 22.00</font>
		</ul>
